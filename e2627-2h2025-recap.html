Executive Summary</h2><p data-path-to-node="2">The second half of 2025 represents a watershed moment in the maritime industry's transition toward a fully cyber-resilient operational framework. Following the mandatory entry into force of the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) Unified Requirements (UR) E26 and E27 on July 1, 2024, the subsequent twelve months were characterized by initial friction, interpretive ambiguity, and preparatory calibration. However, the period spanning July 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025, has witnessed a definitive maturation of the compliance landscape. The industry has shifted from theoretical preparation to tangible, certified execution, evidenced by a surge in Type Approvals for critical Operational Technology (OT) and the successful delivery of the first generation of "cyber-notated" vessels.</p><p data-path-to-node="3">This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the compliance ecosystem during this critical semester. It synthesizes data from classification society rule updates, manufacturer certifications, shipyard announcements, and major industry events to construct a comprehensive picture of the current state of maritime cyber resilience. The analysis reveals that the "compliance lag"—the temporal gap between regulatory mandates and industrial adoption—is rapidly closing, driven by the aggressive mobilization of the supply chain and the rigorous enforcement of new class rules.</p><p data-path-to-node="4">A defining characteristic of H2 2025 has been the convergence of cyber resilience with decarbonization. The data indicates a strong correlation between "green" vessel technologies and cyber certification. A significant proportion of the Approvals in Principle (AiP) granted during this period—particularly those unveiled at Gastech 2025—were for next-generation assets such as ammonia-fueled carriers, electric propulsion container ships, and autonomous systems. This suggests that the industry no longer views cyber resilience as a standalone regulatory hurdle but as an intrinsic, non-negotiable quality of the "smart" and "sustainable" vessel transition.</p><p data-path-to-node="5">Furthermore, the latter half of 2025 saw the emergence of distinct regional strategies. Japanese stakeholders, led by ClassNK and major manufacturers like Furuno and Nabtesco, have emphasized hardware certification and rigorous guideline adherence. In contrast, the South Korean shipbuilding cluster, dominated by HD Hyundai and Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI), has focused on integrated system approvals that bundle cyber security with complex alternative fuel technologies. Meanwhile, European entities have pioneered the application of these standards in the specialized offshore wind sector.</p><p data-path-to-node="6">This report dissects these developments through a structured analysis of regulatory evolution, supply chain dynamics, shipyard integration strategies, and strategic industry events, offering a detailed roadmap of the maritime sector's digital fortification.</p><hr data-path-to-node="7"><h2 data-path-to-node="8">2. Regulatory Evolution and Classification Society Dynamics (H2 2025)</h2><p data-path-to-node="9">The enforcement mechanism for IACS URs lies with the individual classification societies. In the latter half of 2025, these organizations moved beyond the initial adoption phase to refine their rule sets, offering granular guidance that addresses the practical challenges encountered during the first year of mandatory compliance. This period was marked by a shift from generic interpretations to specific, operationally adaptable frameworks.</p><h3 data-path-to-node="10">2.1 DNV: The "Fleet-in-Service" and Rule Overhaul</h3><p data-path-to-node="11">DNV, maintaining its position as a dominant force in maritime standardization, executed a comprehensive update to its regulatory framework in July 2025. This update was crucial for integrating cyber resilience into the standard vessel lifecycle management, moving it from a design-phase consideration to a continuous operational requirement.</p><h4 data-path-to-node="12">2.1.1 July 2025 Rule Edition</h4><p data-path-to-node="13"><span data-path-to-node="13,0">The July 2025 edition of DNV's <strong data-path-to-node="13,0" data-index-in-node="31">Rules for Classification of Ships</strong> introduced critical clarifications regarding the <strong data-path-to-node="13,0" data-index-in-node="114">Cyber Secure (Essential)</strong> notation.</span><span data-path-to-node="13,1"><sup class="superscript" data-turn-source-index="1">1</sup></span><span data-path-to-node="13,2"> This notation, which became mandatory for newbuilds contracted after July 1, 2024, is fully aligned with IACS UR E26 and E27. The 2025 update formalized the transition of this requirement from a "new rule" to a standard operational procedure for shipyards and owners.</span></p><p data-path-to-node="14"><span data-path-to-node="14,0">One of the most significant structural changes in the 2025 rules was the bifurcation of class notations into <strong data-path-to-node="14,0" data-index-in-node="109">"Design"</strong> and <strong data-path-to-node="14,0" data-index-in-node="122">"In-Operation"</strong> categories.</span><span data-path-to-node="14,1"><sup class="superscript" data-turn-source-index="2">2</sup></span><span data-path-to-node="14,2"> Previously, cyber security notations often conflated technical design features with operational management. The new structure explicitly distinguishes between the physical and technical design of the vessel—covered under the <strong data-path-to-node="14,2" data-index-in-node="226">CYBER SECURE</strong> design notation—and the operational management systems, covered under the <strong data-path-to-node="14,2" data-index-in-node="313">Cyber Security Management System (CSMS)</strong> in-operation notation.</span><span data-path-to-node="14,3"><sup class="superscript" data-turn-source-index="2">2</sup></span><span data-path-to-node="14,4"> This nuance is critical for shipowners, as it acknowledges that a vessel designed with robust cyber resilience can still be operated insecurely if management processes fail. It allows for a more targeted compliance assessment, where a lapse in operational procedure does not necessarily invalidate the vessel's design certification.</span></p><h4 data-path-to-node="15">2.1.2 Fleet-in-Service Rules (Effective July 2025)</h4><p data-path-to-node="16"><span data-path-to-node="16,0">Perhaps the most impactful bureaucratic development was the release of the new <strong data-path-to-node="16,0" data-index-in-node="79">Fleet-in-Service</strong> rules, which became available via the DNV Veracity portal starting June 14, 2025.</span><span data-path-to-node="16,1"><sup class="superscript" data-turn-source-index="2">2</sup></span><span data-path-to-node="16,2"> These rules clarify retention schemes for vessels already in operation. While UR E26 is primarily a newbuild standard, the Fleet-in-Service update provides a clear pathway for "In-Operation" notations to be applied to existing fleets. This creates a bridge for owners who wish to harmonize the cyber posture of their legacy tonnage with their newbuilds, ensuring a consistent fleet-wide security standard.</span></p><p data-path-to-node="17"><span data-path-to-node="17,0">The update also introduced the <strong data-path-to-node="17,0" data-index-in-node="31">CO2 RECOND</strong> notation in July 2025.</span><span data-path-to-node="17,1"><sup class="superscript" data-turn-source-index="3">3</sup></span><span data-path-to-node="17,2"> While primarily a decarbonization notation focused on the reconditioning of carbon dioxide for capture and storage, its introduction parallels the cyber updates. The complex process control systems required for CO2 reconditioning fall squarely under the scope of "Essential Systems" in UR E26, highlighting the increasing interdependence of environmental compliance and cyber resilience.</span></p><h3 data-path-to-node="18">2.2 ClassNK: The August 2025 Guidelines</h3><p data-path-to-node="19">ClassNK (Nippon Kaiji Kyokai) adopted a proactive educational approach in H2 2025. In August 2025, the society released updated editions of its guidelines for both E26 and E27, reflecting the "lessons learned" from the first year of mandatory implementation.</p><h4 data-path-to-node="20">2.2.1 Guidelines for Cyber Resilience of Ships (Edition 1.1)</h4><p data-path-to-node="21"><span data-path-to-node="21,0">Published in August 2025, Edition 1.1 serves as a detailed commentary on <strong data-path-to-node="21,0" data-index-in-node="73">Part X (UR E26)</strong> of ClassNK's Rules.</span><span data-path-to-node="21,1"><sup class="superscript" data-turn-source-index="4">4</sup></span><span data-path-to-node="21,2"> The revision was driven by a need for "more practical examples" and "enhanced explanations," addressing specific areas of confusion that arose during the initial implementation phase.</span><span data-path-to-node="21,3"><sup class="superscript" data-turn-source-index="4">4</sup></span></p><p data-path-to-node="22"><span data-path-to-node="22,0">A primary focus of the updated guidelines is the clarification of the document submission process during the <strong data-path-to-node="22,0" data-index-in-node="109">commissioning</strong> phase. This phase is a critical bottleneck where the physical verification of cyber defenses—such as network segmentation tests and access control validation—must occur before vessel delivery.

This includes requirements for secure coding practices, vulnerability testing during development, and rigorous change management procedures.</span></p><h3 data-path-to-node="25">2.3 ABS: The "Cyber Resilience (CR)" Expansion</h3><p data-path-to-node="26">The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) focused heavily on extending cyber resilience concepts into the offshore and retrofit markets in H2 2025, demonstrating that compliance is not limited to conventional commercial shipping.</p><h4 data-path-to-node="27">2.3.1 The "CR-Ex" Notation</h4><p data-path-to-node="28"><span data-path-to-node="28,0">In a landmark development in September 2025, ABS awarded the first <strong data-path-to-node="28,0" data-index-in-node="67">CR-Ex</strong> (Cyber Resilience-Existing) notation to <strong data-path-to-node="28,0" data-index-in-node="113">Jana Marine Services</strong> for three self-elevating units: <i data-path-to-node="28,0" data-index-in-node="166">JANA 505</i>, <i data-path-to-node="28,0" data-index-in-node="176">JANA 508</i>, and <i data-path-to-node="28,0" data-index-in-node="190">JANA 509</i>.</span><span data-path-to-node="28,1"><sup class="superscript" data-turn-source-index="6">6</sup></span><span data-path-to-node="28,2"> This event is significant because it represents the successful migration of E26 principles—originally designed for newbuilds—into the existing fleet. The "Ex" designation explicitly acknowledges that these are not new vessels but have undergone retrofits or procedural upgrades to meet the cyber resilience standards. This signals a growing market appetite for retrofitting cyber compliance, likely driven by charterer requirements in high-value sectors like offshore energy, where asset integrity is paramount.</span></p><h4 data-path-to-node="29">2.3.2 Wireless Safety Systems Approval</h4><p data-path-to-node="30"><span data-path-to-node="30,0">In October 2025, ABS awarded an <strong data-path-to-node="30,0" data-index-in-node="32">Approval in Principle (AiP)</strong> to <strong data-path-to-node="30,0" data-index-in-node="63">Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI)</strong> for a novel wireless fire and gas detection system.</span><span data-path-to-node="30,1"><sup class="superscript" data-turn-source-index="7">7</sup></span><span data-path-to-node="30,2"> Wireless systems have historically been viewed with caution in cyber resilience frameworks due to their susceptibility to jamming and interception. By granting an AiP, ABS has signaled that wireless safety systems can meet E26 requirements if they employ robust countermeasures, such as proprietary encryption protocols and signal monitoring. This approval challenges traditional hard-wired architectures and opens the door for more flexible, cost-effective safety system designs in the future.</span></p><h3 data-path-to-node="31">2.4 Bureau Veritas (BV) and Korean Register (KR)</h3><p data-path-to-node="32">Bureau Veritas (BV) and the Korean Register (KR) also made significant strides in H2 2025, focusing on collaborative projects and the integration of cyber standards with green technologies.</p><h4 data-path-to-node="33">2.4.1 BV's Dynamic Testing JDP</h4><p data-path-to-node="34"><span data-path-to-node="34,0">In December 2025, BV launched a Joint Development Project (JDP) with <strong data-path-to-node="34,0" data-index-in-node="69">Hyundai LNG Shipping</strong> and <strong data-path-to-node="34,0" data-index-in-node="94">Igloo Corporation</strong>.</span><span data-path-to-node="34,1"><sup class="superscript" data-turn-source-index="8">8</sup></span><span data-path-to-node="34,2"> This project is notable because it moves beyond static certification to testing "security policy, monitoring, and response" in an operational environment using Igloo's <strong data-path-to-node="34,2" data-index-in-node="169">SPiDER OT</strong> platform. This represents a shift toward dynamic, real-time compliance monitoring, where the vessel's cyber posture is continuously assessed rather than just checked at delivery.</span></p><h4 data-path-to-node="35">2.4.2 KR's Green-Cyber Nexus</h4><p data-path-to-node="36"><span data-path-to-node="36,0">Korean Register's announcements, particularly at <strong data-path-to-node="36,0" data-index-in-node="49">Gastech 2025</strong>, underscored the deep connection between cyber resilience and alternative fuels.

The Supply Chain Revolution: UR E27 Implementation</h2><p data-path-to-node="39">The second half of 2025 saw a rapid acceleration in the issuance of Type Approvals for onboard systems. Under IACS UR E27, critical systems (Essential Systems) must be certified for cyber resilience. The diversity of systems receiving approval—from navigation and internal communications to propulsion control and remote monitoring—indicates that the supply chain has largely mobilized to meet the new standards. This "compliance surge" suggests that suppliers who failed to secure certification in the first half of the year are now scrambling to catch up, as shipyards enforce strict vendor lists for post-2024 contracts.</p><h3 data-path-to-node="40">3.1 Navigation and Bridge Systems</h3><p data-path-to-node="41">The bridge remains the most interconnected, and therefore most scrutinized, zone on a vessel.

The regulatory frameworks have been stress-tested and refined, the supply chain has mobilized, and the first generation of compliant vessels is entering service. Cyber resilience has ceased to be a theoretical discussion; it is now a fundamental, operational reality of modern shipping.</p><hr data-path-to-node="97"><h2 data-path-to-node="98">9.
